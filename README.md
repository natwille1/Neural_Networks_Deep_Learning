# Neural_Networks_Deep_Learning
This repository contains python scripts that implement various neural networks for classification of the MNIST data set. 
The scripts implement solutions to problems set out in the "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" ebook by Michael Nielsen. 
The book can be found here: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html.
